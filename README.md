## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From the start of this project, I decided as an extra challenge to refrain from using JavaScript. I used the <details> and <summary> tags to achieve the desired effect and changed the default behavior using CSS. It was more complicated than I anticipated since I had to deal with unexpected bugs on Chrome and Safari. If I had to do it again, I would use JavaScript, but the silver lining is that I learned a lot about the intricacies of CSS.

### Continued development

For my next project, I will try to practice my JavaScript skills and CSS grid. Restricting myself to a few technologies was enlightening and is occasionally useful, but I also need to practice using the most modern solutions in web development.

### Useful resources

-   [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://rwd.education/) - This book by _Ben Frain_ is where I first learned that it was possible to make an accordion without using JavaScript.
-   [Code Demo](https://codepen.io/frederickallen/pen/NZMEMw) - This code demo showed me how to change `<details>` and `<summary>` default behavior and deal with Safari's idiosyncrasies.
-   [Box-shadow generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Background_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator) - This is a fantastic tool that helped me generate the values for the `box-shadow` property. I'd recommend it to anyone using this property.
-   [Color contrast accessibility tools](https://css-tricks.com/color-contrast-accessibility-tools/) - This [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) article contains links to many tools to help choose colors while adhering to accessibility guidelines. It was a life saver and I'm planning on using it on all my other projects.
